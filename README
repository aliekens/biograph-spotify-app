This is our entry for the Amsterdam Music Hackday, held 24&25 March 2012.

For now, this is quite rough. Provided with a playing song, our recommendation backend at http://music.biograph.be is called to generate a playlist of recommended artists' songs. When playing a song from this playlist, we display an explanation on why this artist is recommended for the original artist.

Lots more work on this hack is required, but at least you can already play with it if you want.

You can use this app by installing this app as ~/Spotify/biograph-spotify-app and then access it from within Spotify by typing "spotify:app-biograph-spotify-app" in the search field.
